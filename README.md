> Catharsis â€“ n., the discharge of extreme, often negative emotion

People feel a wide range of emotions, with extreme emotions like excitement or misery being just as common as mellow emotions like boredom or uneasiness.

Sometimes, it's easier to talk to a friend. But if you're like me, sometimes you just need to get your thoughts out. You just need to vent, get everything out there for you to see.
