# Inspiration
> Catharsis – n., the discharge of extreme, often negative emotion

People feel a wide range of emotions, with extreme emotions like excitement or misery being just as common as mellow emotions like boredom or uneasiness.

Sometimes you just need to get your thoughts out. You just need to vent, get everything out there for only you to see.

The motivation for this project comes from combining two words:
+ modulate – n., exert a modifying or controlling influence on
+ emotion – n., a natural state of mind deriving from mood

In short, modemo hopes to serve as a helpful, neutral medium through which you can discharge your emotions without harm or insecurity. It does not serve to replace human conversation, but to aid where human conversation cannot.
